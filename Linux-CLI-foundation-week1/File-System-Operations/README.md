# File System Operation Task

OBJECTIVE:
- To simulate the company structure and organize the files based on their respective departments using Command Line Interface(CLI) commands.
- This activity builds the foundation in linux file management which is useful for File Management.

WHAT I DID?

- I created multiple directories(IT, HR, Finance) within the company(Lab_company)
- I created text files such as reports.txt, application.txt, etc. for HR directory that simulates HR department. Invetory.txt files for IT.
- Moved the files per batch by using wildcards to efficiently move files and reduce errors. 

WHICH COMMAND I USE?

- `mkdir`, `mv`, `rmdir`, `cp`, `touch`, `ls -R`, `pwd`, `*`

PROBLEMS I NOTICE:

- Moving files individually feels slow, repetitive and prone to errors.
- Directories are confusing if you didn't know where you at.
- Locating files consume more time if you didn't know which directory you move it.

HOW DID I FIX IT?

- I used wildcards(`*`) in batch to avoid moving files repeatedly.
- I used often used `pwd` command to know where am I.
- I used `ls -R` to see exactly what files in each directory without leaving the current directory.

Companies has a lot of files and data. Mastering these commands are helpful to manage and organized files properly within the Company Infrastructure.
